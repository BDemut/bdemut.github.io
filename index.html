        Hi! Thanks for checking out my corner of the web :)<br>
        I'm a software engineer who loves learning on the fly and making sure every user's experience is top-notch. I take pride in my ability to tackle challenges, solve problems and create code
        that's efficient, but also readable and understandable for the fellow programmers. When I'm not deep in the tech world, you'll likely find me lost in the melodies of my piano.

            Work
        </h2>
        Since mid 2021 I've been a part of the renowned e-commerce company <a href="https://allegro.pl/">allegro.pl</a>, which millions of people use to shop online.
        Within this organization, my responsibilities predominantly revolve around feature planning and development for the Android application, as well as maintaining and refactoring code, fixing bugs, implementing UI tests etc.
        Furthermore, I am actively engaged in creating a brand new smartwatch application.
        To enrich my multidisciplinary skills I've delved into backend and iOS development, and gave talks for internal conferences.<br><br>

            School
        </h2>
        I hold an engineering (bachelor's) degree in Computer Science from Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, which I obtained with a final grade of 4.5.
        I've been a recipient of the PUT Rector's scholarship for the top 10% of students.
        For my thesis project, I focused on the development of an Android app that was a part of a comprehensive Visit Management System. <br><br>
        
        <!--The idea behind the system was to
        allow companies to effectively monitor and manage activity within their office building (which is needed for certain security certifications), while being easy to use and offering supplementary features for the employees and guests.-->

        This is me! I didn't have my thesis printed out, so I posed with a pdf opened on my phone.

            App
        </h2>
        Prior to getting my first job, I created a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.defconapplications.docmanager">document management app</a> for Android devices.
        It's a free app with over 5 thousand downloads.
        I still use it as my primary document manager for my phone, and work on it in my spare time.<br><br>
