        Hi! I'm a professional cache invalidator and Android Studio restarter, driven by a dedication to writing code that is as clear, simple and readable as possible.
        In my spare time I practice the piano in hopes of one day being a somewhat competent musician.

        </h2>
        Since mid 2021 I've been a part of the renowned e-commerce company <a href="https://allegro.pl/">allegro.pl</a>, which millions of people use to shop online.
        Within this organization, my responsibilities predominantly revolve around feature planning and development for the Android application, as well as maintaining and refactoring code, fixing bugs, implementing UI tests etc.
        Furthermore, I am actively engaged in creating a brand new smartwatch application.
        Additionally I've delved into backend and iOS development, which enriched my multidisciplinary skills.<br><br>

        </h2>
        I hold an engineering (bachelor's) degree in Computer Science from Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.
        For my thesis project, I focused on the development of an Android app that was a part of a comprehensive Visit Management System. The idea behind the system was to
        allow companies to effectively monitor and manage activity within their office building (which is needed for certain security certifications), while being easy to use and offering supplementary features for the employees and guests.

        This is me! I didn't have my thesis printed out, so I posed with a pdf opened on my phone.

        Prior to getting my first job, I created a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.defconapplications.docmanager">document management app</a> for Android devices. I still use it as my primary document manager for my phone, and work on it in my spare time.<br><br>
